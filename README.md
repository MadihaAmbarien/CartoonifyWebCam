*Cartoonify Webcam*
This project uses OpenCV to apply a "cartoon effect" to the live feed from your webcam. It processes the video feed, detects edges, and enhances colors to create a cartoon-like appearance in real time.

Features
-> Real-time cartoon effect on webcam feed.
-> Uses bilateral filtering for noise reduction and edge preservation.
-> Applies adaptive thresholding to detect edges.
-> Converts the webcam feed into a cartoon version.

Requirements
-> Python 3.x
-> OpenCV (cv2)
-> Numpy

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python cartoonify_webcam.py
The webcam window will open, and the live feed will be cartoonified in real time.

Press q to exit the application.

Notes
The script uses OpenCV's cv2.VideoCapture(0) to access the default webcam. If you have multiple webcams, you may need to adjust the index passed to cv2.VideoCapture().

The cartoon effect is achieved using a bilateral filter to smooth out colors while preserving edges, followed by adaptive thresholding for edge detection.
